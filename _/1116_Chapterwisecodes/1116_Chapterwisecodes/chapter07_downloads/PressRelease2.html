<h1 class="epi-fontLg">Alfresco Announces Support for Open Document
Format</h1>
<p><strong>Alfresco Launches ODF Virtual File System at OSCON</strong></p>
<p>LONDON&#8212;July 26, 2006&#8212;Alfresco Software Inc., the first provider of
an open source enterprise content management solution, today announced
full Open Document Format (ODF) support through its ODF Virtual File
System. ODF is an open, XML-based file standard suitable for office
applications and designed for managing features in text, spreadsheet,
charts and graphical documents.<br>
</p>
<p>Alfresco's ODF Virtual File System offers a simple shared drive
interface to any office application. Microsoft Office and Open Office
users alike can save or drag content into intelligent drop-zones, where
rules and actions transparently convert incoming content into the ODF
vendor-neutral format. Documents can automatically be sent through a
controlled review and approval process and also have records management
rules applied to them. </p>
<p>The ability to share documents across organizations without being
tied to the technology, strategy, pricing and decisions of a single
supplier is critical for businesses and government agencies today. The
ability to access content without having a format and technology
imposed on all users is equally important. Alfresco's ODF Virtual File
System addresses these key issues. </p>
<p>"Documents need to be shared across governments and citizens without
imposing one proprietary format and vendor on everyone," said John
Newton, chief technology officer, Alfresco Software, Inc. "Alfresco's
ODF Virtual File System makes document sharing vendor-neutral and
addresses issues such as long-term archival and future-proofing rights
to access content in a non-proprietary, royalty free way." </p>
<p>Alfresco's ODF Virtual File System will be available on July 27,
2006, from the latest Alfresco Community Network build on <a
 href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/alfresco" target="_blank">http://sourceforge.net/projects/alfresco</a>
as 1.4 ODF Preview. A White Paper is also available on <a
 href="http://www.alfresco.com/" target="_blank">www.alfresco.com</a>. </p>
